The Problem Statement:
Ever since you got to college, your parents have been warning you about the freshman fifteen!
You've decided that to combat the extra weight gain, you're going to write a program with your new programming skills to help you!

You'd like to keep track of how many calories you are consuming.
You are hoping that keeping track of this information will nudge you into making better food choices.
Luckily, the foods you eat are labeled with the number of grams of protein, carbohydrates and fat they contain.

Program Setup:
Use these constants to represent the number of calories in each gram of protein, carbohydrates, and fat respectively,

#define CALS_PER_GR_PROTEIN 4
#define CALS_PER_GR_CARB 4
#define CALS_PER_GR_FAT 9

Write a program that asks the user to enter the grams of protein, carbohydrates and fat that they consumed.
Remember to create variables for these values, prompt the user for the information, and use the correct percent codes in your scanfs.
Calculate the total number of calories consumed based on the constants and print the result for the user to see.
