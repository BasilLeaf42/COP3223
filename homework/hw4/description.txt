The Problem Statement:
You and your roommates go through a lot of orange juice.
You've noticed that your roommate goes through more orange juice than you do.
And when they run out, they will take some of yours.

You have been charging your roommate every time they take some of your orange juice.
But it feels a bit silly collecting 50 or 75 cents at a time from them.
You’ve come up with a brilliant plan!
Instead of charging them every time they take your orange juice, you’ll collect money from them after they have taken 10 dollars worth of juice.

Program Setup:
Write a program to mimic this process.
Ask the user to enter the size (in ounces) of the juice containers you buy, as well as the price of those containers (in dollars).
Then prompt the user to enter how many times the roommate took juice. Finally, read the amount the roommate took each time.
Every time the total value of the juice equals or exceeds $10, print out “Your roommate owes you $10.00.”
After all the numbers are entered, if the roommate owes any money, print out the value owed.
