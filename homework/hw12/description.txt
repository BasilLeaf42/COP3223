Pseudocode is a high-level description of a computing process.
It usually looks like code because pseudocode follows some of the common conventions of programming languages.
It is not code, however, as it does not follow any particular programming language syntax.
Instead, it is intended to be read by humans instead of computers.

Many common algorithms are described by pseudocode.
This allows us to have a common descriptor for an algorithm that can then be implemented in any programming language.
It provides an outline for the solution that a programmer can then fill in.

The Problem Statement and Program Setup:
You have a collection of gnomes.
Each gnome has a number so that they can be placed in numerical order.
You wish to write a program to sort these gnomes.
This function will perform a gnome sort to order the gnomes based on their assigned values.
